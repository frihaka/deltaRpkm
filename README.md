# deltaRpkm
An R package for a rapid differential gene presence analysis between similar genomes

# Background 
deltaRpkm is an R package whose main purpose is to quickly identify genes potentially involved in a given phenotype by performing a _differential analysis of genes coverage between two sets of closely related genomes_. <br>
The package provides functions to compute the **RPKM**, the **deltaRPKM**, identify candidate genes filtering and and make heatmap plot.  <br>
It also includes methods to perform some batch effects controls and diagnostics plots.

# Install 
Download the binary file specific to your system and then on a terminal:

``` # download the relevant binary for your platform
deltaRpkm_0.1.0_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz  \# Linux 
deltaRpkm_macos_0.1.0.tgz                     \# MacOs  
deltaRpkm_0.1.0.zip                           \# Windows
```
```# install the package on your system, from the terminal:  
R CMD deltaRpkm_0.1.0_R_x86_64-pc-linux-gnu.tar.gz
```
# Usage
