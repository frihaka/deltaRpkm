# deltaRpkm
An R package for a rapid differential gene presence analysis between similar genomes

deltaRpkm is an R package whose main purpose is to quickly identify genes potentially involved in a given phenotype by performing a differential analysis of genes coverage between two sets of closely related genomes. 
The package provides functions to compute the RPKM, the delta RPKM, candidate genes filtering and heatmap plot. 
It also includes methods to perform some batch effects controls and diagnostics plots.
